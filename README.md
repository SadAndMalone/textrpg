# Text-Based RPG 
## No title yet...

## Hello and Welcome!

This is a small pet project of mine that I've just been throwing some code into whenever I've been feeling too bored. I initially started this project in the fall of 2016, but then scrapped all of the code that I had because it was a complete mess and was beyond saving. Live and learn, right? Basically what this will one day be is a text-based game that is heavily inspired by MUDs such as Aardwolf, as well as more contemporary RPGs such as Runescape. That being said, at the moment I have no intention of making this into a multiplayer game, so I'll need to find ways to make the content actually interesting.

## So what does it do?

At the moment, it is likely the worst game in existence. There is quite literally zero gameplay. Currently you can: 

- ~~__look__: Displays the name and description of your current room followed by the mobs in the room.~~ This is currently broken.
- __rooms__: Displays the name and description of all rooms, followed by the mobs in the room.
- __quit__: Exits the game.
- __literally anything else__: Displays a generic message for unrecognized commands

And that's it! that is the extent of this wonderful, wonderful game.
